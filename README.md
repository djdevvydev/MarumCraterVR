# MarumCraterVR

<h2>Unity Project Files</h2>
<body> Here are the Unity project files for the Marum Crater VR experience. A fresh clone of this repo is ready to be pushed to any Android device operting on API Level 17 or greater (4.2 Jellybean), and should be able to build to iOS devices (UNTESTED) by swapping the build target in Unity.

<p>New assets simply require being plugged in for audio/video tracks to their respective managers in the main Unity Scene.</p>
