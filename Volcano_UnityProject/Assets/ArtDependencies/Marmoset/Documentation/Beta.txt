BETA FEATURES
=============
Skyshop 1.05 ships with several new features that are not quite production ready but fun to play with and a useful preview of what's coming down the line. It is also a way for us to test experimental features out in the wild so if you experience problems with anything beta, please let us know at support@marmoset.co.

**Developers working on existing, large-scale projects would be wise to steer clear of beta features as they may change in the next few releases.

SKIN SHADER
Spherical harmonics allows for fancier lighting and IBL scattering simulations so Skyshop 1.05 includes the beginnings of a skin shader in the Marmoset/Beta category.

Sub-Surface Scattering - Simulation of how light enters the dermal and subdermal layers of skin, bounces around a bit, and bounces back out.

Translucency - Simulation of how light passes through thin parts of the model directly; for example, ear lobes and lips.

Peach Fuzz - Simulation of tiny fibers on a surface reflecting and refracting light at grazing viewing angles. Also known as "Diffuse Fresnel".

Anisotropic Highlights - Typically a hair-shader feature, a simulation of specular light reflecting off a mass of aligned strands, forming a long, linear highlight perpendicular to these strands.

---
Subdermis & Subdermis Color
- Define the amount of sub-surface scattering that happens in the subdermal layers of skin
- 0 means standard diffuse lighting, 255 is maximum scattering
- Can be defined per color component. Human skin scatters more red light than blue for instance.

Subdermis(RGB) Skin Mask(A)
- RGB of this texture defines Subdermis strength/color.
- A of this texture masks off ALL skin shader effects.
- Skin mask is useful for rendering clothing, jewelry, etc. within the same texture sheet.

Translucency & Sky Translucency
- Translucency defines the color and amount of light that can pass through to the back-side of the model.
- Sky Translucency is a multiplier on the amount of image-based light transmits to the back-side (it's often useful to tone this down).

Translucency Map
- RGB of this texture defines Translucency strength & color.

Fuzz & Fuzz Color
- Strength and color of diffuse fresnel at grazing angles of the model.

Fuzz Scatter 
- Defines the falloff of diffuse fresnel at grazing angles

Fuzz Occlusion
- Amount of shadowing and self-occlusion used to mask fuzz on the dark side of a model and within shadows

FAST SKIN SHADER
A fast version of the SH-based skin shader, optimized for mobile by keeping texture samples and complexity down to a useful minimum.

Key differences include:
 - Shader has NoForwardAdd flag (one directional light only)
 - Combined texture for Diffuse (RGB) Gloss (A)
 - Uniform specular color/intensity, no specular map
 - Uniform subdermis color, no subdermis map or skin mask
 - Uniform translucency color, No translucency map
 - No IBL translucency (direct lights only)
 - No IBL specular (direct lights only)
 - No anisotropic highlights
 - No alpha testing

HAIR SHADER
A special alpha-blended version of the skin shader is now included as a separate hair shader. The hair shader also features anisotropic highlights and shadow alpha testing.

Anisotropy & Anisotropy Direction
- Amount of "stretching" of the specular highlight
- Anisotropy Direction defines tangent-space (uv-space) direction of highlight stretching.
- Only affects direct lighting
- Useful for hair

Shadow Cutoff
- Alpha testing threshold for the shadow caster pass
- Controls silhouette of shadow cast by alpha-blended hair

REFRACTIVE SHADER
A simple bump-specular IBL shader that refracts the the specular cubemap according to an index of refraction slider.
- Diffuse alpha determines the "smokiness" and diffuse opacity of the glass
- Diffuse color determines the color of the "smokiness"
- Specular color determines the tint of refracted light
- Specular Intensity determines the percent of light refracted (not absorbed)
- Index of Refraction derermines the angles of refraction and total internal reflection based on Fresnel's equations
- Fresnel Strength is a hacky view-based falloff of specular intensity (no physical basis for this)
